GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration, mainly used by software developers to manage and share their code. It is based on Git, a version control system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing multiple people to work on the same project without conflicting changes.

Here are some key features of GitHub:

Version Control: GitHub tracks the history of changes made to files in a project, so you can easily go back to previous versions of the code if needed.

Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project, and GitHub allows them to contribute by "forking" repositories (making copies) and submitting "pull requests" (proposing changes). Other developers can review and merge these changes.

Public & Private Repositories: GitHub allows you to create both public and private repositories. Public repositories are open to everyone, while private ones are restricted to a select group of people.

Documentation: GitHub allows you to create and maintain documentation, such as README files, to explain how your project works and how to use it.

Issue Tracking: You can use GitHub to track bugs, feature requests, and other tasks related to your project through "issues."

GitHub Actions: This feature automates workflows for building, testing, and deploying code, making the development process more efficient.

Overall, GitHub is a powerful tool for managing code and collaborating with other developers in open-source projects or private development teams.
